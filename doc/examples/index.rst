Examples
========

The primary examples that might be useful are those showing the different :doc:`<\processing>` steps and the basics of the :doc:`picking gui <\picking>`.

Additional examples are provided showing :doc:`plotting <\plotting>` both via the command line and via the API, and :doc:`loading <\loading>`, though loading in ImpDAR is a single line so the examples are trivial.
