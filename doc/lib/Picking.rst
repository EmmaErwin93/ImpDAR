Interpretation
==============

Interpretation in this context primarily means picking layers (either isochrones or the bed). In the future, this functionality may be expanded to make picking other things, e.g. some discontinuity, easier.

Functions used for picking
--------------------------

.. automodule:: impdar.lib.picklib
    :members:


Classes used by interpreter
---------------------------

These classes are broken down to match the structure of StODeep, so we store information about how the picks get made, and the picks themselves, using different objects.

.. automodule:: impdar.lib.Picks
    :members:

.. automodule:: impdar.lib.PickParameters
