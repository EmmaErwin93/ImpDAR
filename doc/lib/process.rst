Processing
==========
If interacting with the API, most processing steps should probably be called by using methods on `RadarData` objects, so see :doc:`that documentation<\./RadarData>` for most of your needs. However, you may need to concatenate, which is defined separately because it acts on multiple objects.

.. automethod:: impdar.lib.process.concat
