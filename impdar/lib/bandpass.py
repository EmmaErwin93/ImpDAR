    # bandpass.m  v2.1 - this function performs a banspass filter in the
    # time-domain of the radar data to remove environmental noise.  The routine
    # currently uses a 5th order Butterworth filter.
    #
    #Required inputs: 
    #   data_in - standard StoDeep radar data variable
    #   dt      - time per sample in radar data (in sec.)
    #   tnum    - number of traces in profile array
    #   snum    - number of samples in profile array
    #   Low_Corner_Freq - lower frequency limit for the bandpass filter (in MHz)
    #   High_Corner_Freq - upper frequency limit for the bandpass filter (in MHz)
    #	flags   - structure containing record of processes & parameters used on
    #			given file
    #
    #Outputs:
    #   filtdata - filtered radar data with dimensions (snum,tnum)
    #	flags   - structure containing record of processes & parameters used on
    #			given file

    #Created as stand alone script bandpass.m prior to 1997
    #  Modification history:
    #   1) Input changes made by A. Weitzel 7/10/97
    #   2) Switched to 5th-order Butterworth filter - P. Pearson, 7/2001
    #   3) Coverted for use in StoDeep and added pre-allocation of filtdata
    #       variable - B. Welch 10/2001
    #   4) Filters "stackdata" by default (if it exists),
    #		otherwise filters "data" - Peter Pearson, 2/13/02
    #   5) Now user can filter any standard StoDeep data variable that exists in
    #       memory using a menu displayed for the user - L. Smith, 5/27/03
    #   6) Converted to function and data variable is now passed to the function
    #       rather than selected within the script. - B. Welch, 5/1/06
    #	7) Updated input and outputs to include flags structure. Also added
    #		code to update flags structure - J. Olson 7/10/08
